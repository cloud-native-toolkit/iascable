# IasCable

Library and CLI used to generate Infrastructure as Code installable components composed from a catalog of 
modules.

### CLI Usage

#### Installation

To install the latest version of iascable into `/usr/local/bin`, run the following:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-native-toolkit/iascable/main/install.sh | sh
```

If you would like to install a different version of the CLI and/or put it in a different directory, use the following:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-native-toolkit/iascable/main/install.sh | RELEASE=2.8.1 DEST_DIR=~/bin sh
```

#### Commands

```shell
iascable build [-u {CATALOG_URL}] [-i {BOM_INPUT}] [--name {COMPONENT_NAME}]
```

### Bill of Material schema

The Bill Of Material (BOM) yaml has been modeled after a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition. A BOM 
is provided as input to the CLI, either a custom . By default, the module entries for the Bill of Material are pulled
from the Cloud Native Toolkit module catalog - https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev/

In addition to identifying the modules, values can be provided for the variables and dependencies to
configure those modules. The variable names match up with the variable names in the module. The 
dependency `name`/`id` should match the `id` of the dependency in the module metadata. The `ref` value
should match the `name` or `alias` of one of the other modules in the BOM.
